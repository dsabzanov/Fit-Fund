**Prompt for Replit:**

I need your help adding a working **"Home" button** to the second page (`page2.html`) of my website. The button should consistently navigate back to my homepage (`index.html`). To ensure clarity and troubleshooting ease, please follow this structured process and clearly document the outcome of each step:

### Step-by-Step Task:

**Step 1: Basic Implementation**
- Add the following HTML code within the `<body>` of my second page (`page2.html`):
```html
<a href="index.html">
  <button type="button">Home</button>
</a>
Confirm that the button appears correctly.

Test by clicking the buttonâ€”confirm whether it navigates back to index.html.

Step 2: Troubleshooting if Step 1 Fails If the button does not redirect to the homepage:

Clearly document the error or issue encountered.

Next, replace the original button code with this alternative:

html
Copy
Edit
<button onclick="window.location.href='index.html'">Home</button>
Test again and document if this method resolves the issue.

Step 3: Further Troubleshooting (JavaScript Fallback) If both methods fail:

Check and confirm that your files (index.html and page2.html) are in the same directory.

Add the following JavaScript-based navigation method:

html
Copy
Edit
<button id="homeBtn">Home</button>
<script>
  document.getElementById("homeBtn").addEventListener("click", function(){
    window.location.href = 'index.html';
  });
</script>
Test this method thoroughly and clearly document the results.

Required Outcomes:
For each step, explicitly state:

Whether the button renders on the webpage correctly.

Whether the button correctly redirects to index.html.

Any errors or unexpected behavior encountered (include browser console errors if applicable).

Provide your findings clearly and separately for each step, ensuring transparency throughout the troubleshooting process.
