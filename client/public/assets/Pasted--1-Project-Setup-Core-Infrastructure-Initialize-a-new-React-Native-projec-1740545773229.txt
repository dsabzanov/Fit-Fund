| **2. Firebase Configuration**         | Core Infrastructure | Configure Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database, etc.). This ensures secure user data handling, storing meal logs, etc.                            | Project Setup                                                 | - Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).- Enable Authentication providers (Email/Password, Google, Facebook, Apple).- Copy Firebase config into the React Native project.                            |
| **3. UI Get Started Swiper**          | Onboarding          | Implement an onboarding carousel/swiper that appears on first launch. Introduce the app’s features, diet tracking benefits, etc. This helps orient new users.               | Firebase Configuration (to track if user is new or returning) | - Use a swiper library (e.g., `react-native-snap-carousel` or `react-native-swiper`).- Show skip/next buttons. Record completion in Firebase or local storage so the user doesn’t see it again after finishing.                                          |
| **4. UI Privacy Policy**              | Onboarding          | Provide a screen or modal that displays the privacy policy. This is often a legal requirement.                                                                              | UI Get Started Swiper (or can be separate in the menu)        | - Either embed text in the app or load from a hosted webpage.- Consider storing user acceptance in Firebase (e.g., a field `acceptedPrivacyPolicy: true`).                                                                                               |
| **5. UI Login Screen**                | Authentication      | Create the login interface where users enter credentials or choose social sign-in methods. This is a key entry point to the app.                                            | Firebase Configuration (Auth)                                 | - Use React Native components (TextInput, Button).- Show sign-in options (Email/Password, Google, Facebook, Apple).- Include a link to “Forgot Password” and a button to switch to “Sign Up.”                                                            |
| **6. Implement Signin w/ Email**      | Authentication      | Let users sign in with email and password via Firebase Authentication.
